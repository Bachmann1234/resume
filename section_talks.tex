	{Better Testing Less Code: Property Based Testing With Python}{PyCon 2016, QCon 2017}
	{Standard unit tests have developers test specific inputs and outputs. This works, but often what breaks code are the cases we did not think about. Property based testing has developers define properties of output and has the computer explore the possible inputs to verify these properties. This talk will introduce property based testing and provide real world examples and patterns.}

	{Diff Cover}{PyCon lightning talk 2015}
	{Diff Cover is a package I maintain which allows teams to to improve test coverage and code quality over time by running tools over diffs rather than the entire project. It is currently downloaded over fifty-five thousand times per day. In this PyCon lightning talk I introduce the library by using it to assist Batman with his Batputer.}
