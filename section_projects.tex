	{Diff Cover}{2014 - present}
	{\github{Bachmann1234/diff-cover}}
	{Diff Cover is a developer tool that enables a project to build up its code coverage and style requirements over time by running reports on changes to a project rather than the project as a whole. This enables enforcing rules for future pull requests without being distracted by a mountain of warnings that are not relevant to the current work. I was not the original author of this tool but contributed a great deal and took over ownership of the project.}
