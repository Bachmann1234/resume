I am a passionate developer who is constantly striving to improve and gain a deeper understanding of the
systems and people I work with. I believe in giving back to the wider software community though knowledge sharing and open source contributions whenever possible. I work best with highly collaborative teams and enjoy engaging with the wider organization. I am most valuable when I am able to combine my technical skills with a broad understanding of the business and the organization.
