\par{
I am a passionate developer who is constantly striving to improve and gain a deeper understanding of the
systems and people he works with. I believe in giving back to the wider software community though knowledge sharing and open source contributions and whenever possible. I want to work for an organization that enables me to work with people and deeply understand the business. I believe I am most valuable when I am able to align my technical skills to the needs of the business and its people.
